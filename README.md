# MobiiliTietoLiikenneLabs

        This app was made in Oulu University of Applied Sciences for course: IN00BQ32 Mobiilisovellusten kehitysprojekti K2020 TVT18SPO,
        for part Mobiili Tietoliikenne (MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, Mobile Data Communications)\n\n

        App combines all the courses Labs into one for convenience.\n
        Use the spinner to choose the Lab, below it reads the assignment.\n
        And below that, are my notes, if any, and button to launch the assignment.\n
        Use back button to return.\n\n

        Developed in emulator with 5" display and 1920x1080 resolution. 
        Using emulator with lower API level than 29 might require updating Google Play Services. 
        So if you have issues you might try to use those.\n\n
